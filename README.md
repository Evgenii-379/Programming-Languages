## **Сравнение MacOS и Windows**


Comparison Text:

MacOS and Windows are two popular operating systems. Windows is widely used around the world. MacOS is also popular, but not as much.

MacOS has an intuitive interface. It looks clean and is easy to use, especially for people who work in design or media. Windows is more versatile. 

It works well on many computers and supports many third-party apps.

Windows computers are usually cheaper. MacBooks are often more expensive, but they are fast-performing and secure.

In my opinion, Windows is better for general use and gaming. MacOS is great for people who like a simple and smooth system.
