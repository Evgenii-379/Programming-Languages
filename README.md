## **1. Сравнение MacOS и Windows**


Comparison Text:

MacOS and Windows are two popular operating systems. Windows is widely used around the world. MacOS is also popular, but not as much.

MacOS has an intuitive interface. It looks clean and is easy to use, especially for people who work in design or media. Windows is more versatile. 

It works well on many computers and supports many third-party apps.

Windows computers are usually cheaper. MacBooks are often more expensive, but they are fast-performing and secure.

In my opinion, Windows is better for general use and gaming. MacOS is great for people who like a simple and smooth system.

## **6. Задание**
 
Ответьте на следующие вопросы (напишите текст или запишите аудио):

- Do you know when the 1st computer was made? How was it different from what they look like now?
- When was the last time you were invited to a job interview? How did it go?
- Do you know any successful tech companies that were started in a garage? Who were they founded by?


## **Ответ:**

1. Do you know when the 1st computer was made? How was it different from what they look like now?

- The first programmable electronic computer was the ENIAC, created in 1945. It was enormous, filling an entire room, and used vacuum tubes instead of modern microchips. 
Unlike today's compact and fast computers, ENIAC was slow, consumed massive amounts of electricity, and required manual rewiring to perform different tasks. 
Modern computers are millions of times faster, portable, and energy-efficient.

2. When was the last time you were invited to a job interview? How did it go?

- The last time I was invited to a job interview was a few months ago. It went well—I prepared thoroughly, answered technical questions confidently, and had a good discussion with the hiring manager. 
However, I didn’t get the offer, but it was a valuable learning experience.

3. Do you know any successful tech companies that were started in a garage? Who were they founded by?

 Yes! Some famous examples:

- Apple – Founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976.

- Microsoft – Started by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 (though not strictly a garage, it began in a small space).

- Google – Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed Google's early search engine in a garage in 1998.

- Amazon – Jeff Bezos launched it from his garage in 1994.

- HP (Hewlett-Packard) – Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a garage in 1939.
